## **Slide 1 — Title**

### **Exodus**

**Grant Intelligence Infrastructure for Universities**

*Turning research capacity into funded impact*

**Say:**
“Exodus is infrastructure, not another grant search tool.”

---

## **Slide 2 — The Problem**

### **Faculty grants power universities — but the system is inefficient**

**On slide:**

* 25–50 days per proposal
* Grants fragmented across silos
* Eligibility unclear until late
* Collaboration happens too late

**Say:**
“Before faculty know if a grant is worth it, weeks of time are already gone.”

---

## **Slide 3 — Who Is Affected**

### **Two stakeholders, one failure**

**On slide:**

* **Users:** Faculty & researchers
* **Buyers:** Universities & research offices

**Bottom line:**
Faculty bring in money. Institutions depend on it.

**Say:**
“Faculty feel the pain — institutions pay the price.”

---

## **Slide 4 — Why This Matters (IMPACT SLIDE)**

### **Why this actually matters**

**On slide (numbers only):**

* 25–50 days per proposal
* 75–90% rejection rates
* $20k–$40k labor per proposal
* Millions lost annually

**Say:**
“Universities lose millions not because research is weak — but because decisions are made too late.”

---

## **Slide 5 — The Core Insight**

### **The real problem**

**BIG TEXT:**

> *Not all grants are worth applying for.*

**Subtext:**
But no system tells faculty that early.

**Say:**
“This insight alone saves weeks per proposal.”

2. Faculty profile + CV analysis
3. AI fit & eligibility scoring
